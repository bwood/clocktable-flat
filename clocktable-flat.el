  "Write out a flat clock table at position IPOS in the current
buffer.  Useful to render a table which can be exported to CSV and
then imported into accounting/invoiving tools such as Zoho Invoicing.
TABLES is a list of tables with clocking data as produced by
`org-clock-get-table-data'.

PARAMS is the parameter property list obtained from the dynamic block
definition.  Several parameters are used beyond those used by the
clocktable dynamic block:
    :customer A string to be inserted into the 'Customer Name' column
    :price A number to be inserted into the 'Item Price' column as a rate
    :number A string to be inserter into the Invoice Number column
    :columns A list which overrides the default CSV columns from
             `org-clock-clocktable-flat-columns'

Several other columns are calculated automatically:
    Item Name: The path to the parent headline
    Item Desc: The headline
    Quantity: The clocktime.  Useful with the `;t' formatter to get a
              decimal billable time.

; The cons function is used to construct lists, and the car and cdr functions are used to take them apart.
; The car of a list is, quite simply, the first item in the list. Thus the car of the list (rose violet daisy buttercup) is rose.
; The cdr of a list is the rest of the list, that is, the cdr function returns the part of the list that follows the first item. Thus, while the car of the list '(rose violet daisy buttercup) is rose, the rest of the list, the value returned by the cdr function, is (violet daisy buttercup).
